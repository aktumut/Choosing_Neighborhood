## Comparing Specific Moscow and Berlin Neighborhoods
## IBM Data Science Capstone Project
Our customers want to move from Moscow to Berlin.

They want to choose the district in which they will find same services that they are used to have in Moscow.

They need a gym in the neighborhood, some nice cafe, bars and restaurants.

Now they are living in Moscow Khamovniki and it is a very good district. We are searching for district in Berlin that will have same venues on the same distances from the center of the district.

Please check the presentation in the repository for more details.
